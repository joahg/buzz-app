  /** Resolve only returned/demanded nonmember channels, through the verified reader.
   *
   * Search, channel-writes.ts `refresh`, findLabeled, and session.ts membership
   * hints rely on these properties. The create-channel path guards them with real-store tests
   * in channel-writes.test.ts rather than through this store's own suite:
   * - The id filter keeps every channel the store does not yet authorize, so a
   *   just-created channel is confirmed by one exact `#d` read instead of the
   *   full viewer-roster rediscovery. Skipping such ids would send every create
   *   back through the full pass. Session hints route held channels to the full
   *   pass because this filter skips them (including unarchive triggers). See
   *   "admits a created ... channel through the store's exact read without
   *   rediscovering the roster". A member addition to a joined channel is
   *   confirmed by `refreshRoster` below, not by widening this filter.
   * - Events apply through `applyDiscovery`, which always commits the list as
   *   `ready`. Only resolve into a list discovery has already made ready; on an
   *   idle, loading or error list this would publish a ready list holding just
   *   these channels and hide a failed initial discovery. See "creates a channel
   *   during initial discovery without committing a list of only that channel";
   *   its check that every ready snapshot carries the first page's channel is
   *   the canonical regression test.
